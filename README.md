# The Game
A memory game with **React** and **Redux** using **[Hearthstone API](https://rapidapi.com/omgvamp/api/hearthstone)**.
Each round adds one random item to the end of the sequence. When the sequence is finished the player has to click on the items in the order shown to pass to the next round.

### How to run the project
* Install the dependencies by running `yarn install`
* Launch dev server by running `yarn start`
* Run yarn test to run all the test on the project
* Run yarn test:cover to run test and get the code coverage

**Don't forget to use the gold button :P**
